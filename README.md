Jupter notebooks to support CFPD's report on [Land Registry titles registered to overseas individuals](https://www.centreforpublicdata.org/property-data-overseas-individuals).

This repo contains two notebooks:

1. [Prepare data for analysis](Prepare%20data%20for%20analysis.ipynb) - prep and clean FOI data for analysis.
2. [Analyse data](Analyse%20ownership%20by%20overseas%20individuals.ipynb) - notes on all the analysis published in the report, and links to original FOI requests etc.

Feel free to reuse any of this analysis, but please cite the Centre for Public Data as the source.

If you would like a clean copy of the raw data, please contact [anna@centreforpublicdata.org](mailto:anna@centreforpublicdata.org).

**Update June 2023**: We have made corrections to our original report due to errors in data supplied by HM Land Registry - see [the blog post](https://www.centreforpublicdata.org/blog/correction-from-hm-land-registry-updated-report) for details.
